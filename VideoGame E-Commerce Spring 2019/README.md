# VideoGame E-commerce
Using basic procedural development, this site simulates the process of buying a videogame.
It allows customers the ability to add games to their shopping cart and "purchase" them after signing in.
Admins can also sign in and are given all Database privileges inlcuding setting prices, adding pictures, and creating descriptions. 
This was made using NetBeans and was a collaborative effort by Hector Sanchez and Garin Wurschmidt.
