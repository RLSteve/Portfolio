This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)

This was my first informatics project. With virtually no direction I was told to make a website. I decided to make a single page informative website about the past present and future of AI in the medical field. I obviously used a bootstrap but this project goes to show my determination to get whatever I need done, well... done. I made this with virtually no-clue as to what I was doing and things just worked out. Wasn't easy but man I was proud. This bootstrap was adapted by Garin Wurschmidt in the text and certain icons.
