Heck Yea Boards
This was intended to be an in-house inventory system. 
The system allows only admins to create users and other admins. Regular users without the admin attribute can only view and search products.
Admins can edit, add, and delete products as well as create new brands within the database. 
This app was created from scratch by Garin Wurschmidt, Tyler Jump, and last but certainly not least Tyler Faircloth.
