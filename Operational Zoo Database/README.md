# Operational Zoo DB
This project is an operational database that connects food types to animals to locations to shifts to workers to paygrade and
includes an ex-employee table. The SQL file contains the actual database while the .txt file contains useful queries and joins that
the database supports along with reasoning for them. This database was made from scratch by Garin Wurschmidt.
